Information on background radiation

Values often given in mSv/yr. Our measurements are in uSv/hr. The conversion is 0.1141(uSv/hr) = mSv/year if that hourly dose rate is consistent the entire year

ranges widely based on where you live
average = 2.4 mSv/year, ~3mSv/year in North America
Can range from 1 mSv/year to 10 mSv/year, but places where people live have recorded up to 50 mSv/year.
There is a beach in Brazil (uninhabited) with yearly natural background of 800 msV/year (mostly from radon)
Americans also receive a yearly dose from medical procedures and living near nuclear power plants

Public dose limits
1 mSv/yr above backround is limit for nuclear power plants exposure to population in the US
100 mSv/yr (11.41 uSv/h average)= lowest annual dose at which an increase in the chance of cancer has been observed
